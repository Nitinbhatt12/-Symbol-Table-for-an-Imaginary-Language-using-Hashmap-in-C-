## File Descriptions

### `hashmap.h`
- **Purpose**: Header file for the hashmap implementation.
- **Description**: Defines structures and prototypes for the hashmap and symbol table, including the `Node` and `Hashtable` structures, and declares functions for hash calculation, insertion, display, and scope management.

### `hashmap.c`
- **Purpose**: Implementation of the hashmap and symbol table functionality.
- **Description**: Contains the implementation of the hash function, insertion, display, scope management, and memory cleanup functions.

### `wtof.c`
- **Purpose**: Main program to simulate a symbol table for an imaginary programming language.
- **Description**: Reads commands from `program.txt` to perform operations like creating scopes, assigning variables, and printing values using the hashmap implementation.

### `id.c`
- **Purpose**: Helper program to demonstrate type detection and value printing.
- **Description**: Reads values from a file, determines their type (integer, float, or string), and prints them in a formatted way.
this file has not been uploaded but features are there in wtof.c

### `program.txt`
- **Purpose**: Input file containing commands for the symbol table simulation.
- **Description**: Contains commands like `begin`, `end`, `assign`, and `print` to simulate a program in an imaginary language.
